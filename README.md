# infosec_resources
List of useful information on the topic of information security

This repo is a collection of resources on the topic of information security. It includes useful links, tools, tutorials for my personal education, that might be useful to other people.

If you want to start learning about this field of IT, it would be my personal advice to create a lab. There you can try out stuff. https://twitter.com/da_667 created a very useful cookbook on how to achieve this. The first edition became known as 'Project Avatar' and was printed as 'Building Virtual Machine Labs: A Hands-On Guide'. It was rewritten this year and is available as 'Building Virtual Machine Labs: A Hands-On Guide Second Edition'.

I will add new resources in the future, but this depends on my time. Planned resources are links to CTF walkthroughs like ippsec, links to tutorials for beginners, links to tools like shodan, VT, CVE lists, useful tools for Pentesting, WebAppPentesting, Forensics etc. This repo is a work in progress and I will try to give the sources in a structured way.
